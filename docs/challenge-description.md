# Solana TX Data Extract, Storage, API Code Challenge

## Objective

Build a simple Rust application that interacts with the Solana blockchain to process and store transaction data and provide a queryable API endpoint.

## Challenge Details

### 1. **Fetch and Process Blockchain Data**
Create an application in Rust that:
- **Interacts with the Solana blockchain** to fetch transaction data from the [Phoenix on-chain orderbook DEX](https://www.phoenix.trade/) program.
- **Decodes transactions** and extracts trade fill events.
- **Stores the processed data** in a database of your choice (Postgres or ClickHouse preferred).
- Runs **continuously** to fetch new transactions, parse them, and insert the extracted trade fill events into the database in real-time or near real-time.

### 2. **Build an API Endpoint**
Develop a RESTful API in Rust to query the processed data:
- The API should return data in [OHLC format (Open, High, Low, Close)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ohlcchart.asp).
- **Endpoint Requirements:**
  - Accept the following request parameters:
    - `baseTokenMint`: The mint address of the base token.
    - `quoteTokenMint`: The mint address of the quote token.
    - `startTime` and `endTime`: Specify the time range for the query (e.g., in UNIX timestamp format).
    - `interval/resolution`: Specify the interval for aggregation (e.g., 1m, 1h, 1d, etc.).
  - Validate input parameters and return meaningful error messages for invalid requests.
  - Support efficient queries from the database to return the requested OHLC data.

### 3. **Database Considerations**
- Design a database schema that supports:
  - Storage of trade fill events.
  - Efficient querying for OHLC data based on the parameters.
- Populate the database with **dummy data** for testing if necessary. Ensure the database schema includes an **additional column** to differentiate between real and dummy data.

## Bonus Tasks (not required)
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the API (e.g., limit requests per minute per client IP).
- **Credit Management:** Add a basic credit management system where:
  - Each API request deducts 1 credit in real time.
  - The system returns an appropriate error if the client has insufficient credits.

## RPC API & Resources

You can use any RPC provider of your choice, but we recommend the following approach for convenience:

1. Visit the [Helius Dev Portal](https://dev.helius.xyz/dashboard/app), log in with your preferred method, and retrieve your free API key.
2. Set this API key as an environment variable in your application.
3. Use the endpoint `https://rpc.helius.xyz/?api-key=${YOUR_API_KEY}` to fetch data.  
   - **Note**: This endpoint has a rate limit of **25 RPC requests per second**.

To fetch transactions for the Phoenix DEX Program:
- Use the [getSignaturesForAddress](https://docs.solana.com/api/http#getsignaturesforaddress) method to get a list of transaction signatures.
- Decode these transactions to extract the relevant trade fill events.

For decoding and understanding the Phoenix DEX data:
- The [Phoenix SDK repository](https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/phoenix-sdk/tree/master) provides helpful insights into the data structures and logic for identifying and extracting trade fill events.

These are suggested guidelines to help you get startedâ€”you are welcome to use alternative approaches if preferred.


## Testing (Optional but Recommended)

While not mandatory, it is encouraged to include a basic suite of tests that cover the core functionality of your application.

- **Focus Areas**: Test critical paths such as blockchain interaction, data decoding, and the OHLC endpoint logic.
- **Test Coverage**: 100% code coverage is not required but demonstrating thoughtful testing is a plus.

## Development and Build Environment

Your submission should include a fully working development environment. Ensure you provide:
- Clear instructions for setting up the application.
- Steps for installing dependencies and running the application in a development environment.
- **Development Tools**: You are welcome to use tools like Docker to simplify setup and manage dependencies if it makes the process easier.

## Submission Guidelines

Please submit your work via a GitHub repository. Your submission should include:

1. **Source Code**: The complete application codebase.
2. **Test Files**: Include any test files and instructions to run the tests, if applicable.
3. **README File**: A README containing:
   - Detailed setup instructions, including how to:
     - Install dependencies.
     - Run the application.
     - Execute tests (if applicable).
   - Instructions for using the application.
4. **Database with Trade Fills Data**: Include a database containing the processed trade fills data.
5. **Additional Documentation**:
   - Explain your assumptions.
   - Describe your architecture decisions.
   - Highlight any notable implementation details.


## Expectations and Time Guidelines

- **Estimated Time**: This challenge is estimated to take approximately **4-6 hours** to complete the core requirements. This is not a hard limit but rather a guideline to help you plan your time. If you find yourself significantly exceeding this estimate, feel free to let us know.
- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - Your approach to solving the problem.
  - Code quality and maintainability.
  - Choice of libraries/tools.
  - Adherence to best practices.

Good luck, and we look forward to your submission!
